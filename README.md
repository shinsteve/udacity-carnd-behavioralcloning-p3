Overview
---

This repository is to submit the project outcome of [Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree - Behavioral Cloning](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3)

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
